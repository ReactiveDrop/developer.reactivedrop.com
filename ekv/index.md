# Encrypted Key-Values Files

This folder contains decrypted versions of the [EKV](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Encrypted_Key_Values) files shipped with Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop, for reference.

These files are encrypted mostly because the library Valve provided us expects encrypted files. This was presumably done to make it harder to casually modify graphics settings that could cause the game to perform badly.

Some console variables listed in these files do not exist in Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop. This is because they were copied from the Left 4 Dead engine branch when the Alien Swarm engine branch was created.
