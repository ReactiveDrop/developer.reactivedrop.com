# Ben Lubar's Public TODO List

This page will occasionally be updated (when I remember) and completed or cancelled tasks will eventually be cleared (arbitrarily).

## Always

### Crashes

If you have a mdmp file, [upload it to the feedback site](https://feedback.reactivedrop.com/open.php?topicId=12) along with as much information as you can about what happened right before the crash. Bonus points if you have instructions that guarantee the crash will happen (it's much easier to debug a live copy of the game than a minidump for some of the more confusing crashes.)

### Community Medals

If you think you should have a medal (especially medals like Streamer, Guide, and Artist that are harder for me to keep track of), [file a ticket on the feedback site](https://feedback.reactivedrop.com/open.php?topicId=23). Seriously, if you have an argument for why you should have a medal it is quite likely valid. The reason most people don't have a medal is that I simply didn't see what they did or did see and forgot to give them the medal.

### Bugs and Exploits

If something in the game isn't working right, [leave a note on the issue tracker](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_public_src/issues). Make sure there's not an active report for the same thing already, of course. We tend to fix bugs that help speedrunners only if they can be performed by accident and have a negative effect, like an out of bounds exploit that makes it hard to complete the mission or a collision problem that trivializes the entire map. If there's something sensitive about your report, feel free to send it through the feedback site instead. Videos, screenshots, and demos can be helpful if what you're reporting is at all complicated.

### New Features, Content, and Ideas

If there's something you want to see added to the game, [the feedback forum](https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/) is a great place to post about it. There are also a lot of active people in the [official Discord guild](https://discord.com/invite/c43TDaQ) including members of the Reactive Drop Team who might be able to help you make your own idea real. No promises, of course.

## Specific Deadlines

### MAY 9: Steam Endless Replayability Fest 2024

If Valve decides Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop is eligible for [Steam Endless Replayability Fest 2024](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/themed_sales/endlessreplayability_2024), a medal will be available for playing the game during the event, from May 13 at 10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7) to May 20 at 10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7).

Just as with Steam SHMUP Fest 2023, we won't be having any discounts (because discounts on donations make no sense), but we will be participating in the event with a banner on our store page and a medal granted to anyone who opens the game during the fest.

## Upcoming
