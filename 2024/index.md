# 2023-2024 development year plan

This folder is our current plan for the 7th anniversary update for Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop in 2024. Everything in here is subject to change, and the contents of this folder may be out of date. Let Ben know if anything seems wrong.

## The Big Picture: Headline Features

The 6th anniversary was heavily geared towards giving mission and challenge authors more tools. We're also adding a lot of stuff for authors in the 7th anniversary update, but our main focus this year is features that players can use *right now*, not having to wait for someone else to make new content. [And maybe some lore.](telic.html) Some of these features also help to pave the foundation for Versus mode, which is not part of this year's update.

- [Armory Expansion](armory-expansion.html)
- [Redesigned UI](interface-redesign.html)
- [Inventory Management](inventory-management.html) *(will need to partially release this sooner)*
- [OCM Contracts](contracts.html)
- [Crafting / Strange Items](crafting.html)
- Mapping Competition: `#SpaceStation2024` *(temp theme, subject to change)*
