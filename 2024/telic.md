# 2024: State of Telic Corporation

It would be very nice to have a remastered version of the Telic and Escape from Rhea campaigns in the game. We're not going to steal anything - as with all official campaigns, the missions will not be added to the game without the blessing of their original authors.

Regardless of whether this can be arranged for the 2024 7th anniversary update, Telic Corporation is a canon part of Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop lore, and some item descriptions will reference Telic Corporation.

Additionally, the first content in the [contract system](contracts-crafting.html) will take place in an as-yet-unseen Telic Corporation facility.

If you were involved with the creation of the Telic or Escape from Rhea campaigns, please reply to the [discussion topic in the Black Cat Games group on the Steam Community](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bcg/discussions/0/5738191325962139939/).
