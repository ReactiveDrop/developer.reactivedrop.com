Campaign is split into 6 areas:

- bonus objective room (The Choice of Progress) contains the starting objective
- Area A revealed after doing starting objective
- Area B and Area C unlocked after Area A completed
- Area D unlocked after B and C completed
- Area E is finale, requires D (and therefore all other areas)

## Dr. Jacques Moreau's Lab `#rd_contract_area_sr_start`

- Translator note: This is the scientist mentioned in some Nam Humanum mail files.
- Area Reward: TODONAME Flechette Launcher

### A Personnel Request `#rd_contract_obj_sr_start`

- Translator note: pun on "Personal Request" meaning this task is from Helvetica rather than the larger OCM organization and "Personnel" because the objective is to push a person towards being employed by OCM. if it's not possible to do the pun in your language, translate as if it was "A Personal Request".
- Location: optional objective room in Groundwork Labs
- Objective giver: Dr. Helvetica Scenario
- Locked flavor: I'm gonna level with you, Commander. There's a scientist I like stuck in a dead-end job with your employer. She'd be a real asset to this thing we're doing here, all she needs is a push out of her comfort zone.
- Unlocked flavor: TODO
- Objective: Complete achievement "The Choice of Progress" 0/1

## Area A (TODO) `#rd_contract_area_sr_west`

## Area B (TODO) `#rd_contract_area_sr_south`
