- [ ] Design
- [ ] Style-selectable items *(needs to be ready by the end of May 2023)*
- [ ] Self-serve item deletion
- [ ] Crafting inventory (materials have dedicated slots to make inventory management cleaner)
- [ ] Inventory sorting (items that do not have dedicated slots can be rearranged; client-side only, unless we can find a way to do it in the inventory service)
- [ ] Additional medal slot
- [ ] Swarmopedia items tab
