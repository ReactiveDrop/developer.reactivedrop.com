# 2024 Armory Expansion

We're adding **twelve** new unlockable weapons, and also a new way to unlock weapons. The max commander level of 34 will not change in this update, and these new weapons will not need to be re-obtained when a commander promotes. They will have requirements to equip that are separate from their requirements to obtain, however. For example, armory access restrictions can re-lock the weapon after a promotion (it will not need to be re-obtained, however).

Eight new Primary/Secondary weapons:

- [DRG19 Cryo Cannon](#new-weapon-drg19-cryo-cannon)
- [G521 Plasma Thrower](#new-weapon-g521-plasma-thrower)
- [TODONAME Flechette Launcher](#new-weapon-flechette-launcher)
- [TODONAME Ricochet Rifle](#new-weapon-ricochet-rifle)
- [HC42 Automated Hacking Tool](#new-weapon-hc42-automated-hacking-tool)
- [IAF Railgun Sentry](#new-weapon-iaf-railgun-sentry)
- [TC79 Energy Field Generator](#new-weapon-tc79-energy-field-generator)
- [TC1121 Reanimator](#new-weapon-tc1121-reanimator)

Four new Extra/Equipment weapons:

- [EC-02 Stun Grenades](#new-equipment-ec-02-stun-grenades)
- [NA-23 Incendiary Grenades](#new-equipment-na-23-incendiary-grenades)
- [EX981 Speed Burst Module](#new-equipment-ex981-speed-burst-module)
- [MA9128 Force Dome Generator](#new-equipment-ma9128-force-dome-generator)

## New Weapon: DRG19 Cryo Cannon

- Class Restriction: Special Weapons
- Activation Type: Gun (projectile, spin-up, ammo)
- Secondary Fire: Hold (spin-up)
- Manufacturer: Telic Corporation
- Inspirations: Deep Rock Galactic "Cryo Cannon"

**Lore:** This Telic Corporation prototype was originally meant to be a tool to quickly freeze specimens for safe transport. The Directed Refrigeration Gun had two main problems: first, it was so large and heavy that it required an exosuit to operate. Second, the process of quickly freezing a specimen severely damaged it - or just made it angry. The freezing didn't last very long, and it usually ended with one of the participants shattered or torn to shreds.
