# Donation Items

If you have been contacted by a Reactive Drop Team admin to create a donation item, perform the following steps:

1. Open the developer console in Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop. This is done using the `` ` `` key. If you have not already enabled the developer console, it can be enabled in Keyboard settings.

2. Enter the command:

    ```
    ugc_curated_create
    ```

3. The Steam Overlay (or your system web browser if you have the Steam Overlay disabled) will open to a new Steam Workshop curated item.

4. Edit the title of the item and set up the revenue split on the website.

5. Send the Reactive Drop Team admin a link to the item you created.
