# Donation Items

If you have been contacted by a Reactive Drop Team admin to create a donation item, perform the following steps:

1. Open the developer console in Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop. This is done using the `` ` `` key. If you have not already enabled the developer console, it can be enabled in Keyboard settings.

2. Enter the command:

   ```
   ugc_curated_create
   ```

3. The Steam Overlay (or your system web browser if you have the Steam Overlay disabled) will open to a new Steam Workshop curated item.

4. You will need to have your Steam Workshop payment info set up, which can be done from a link on the page you just opened or on <https://steamcommunity.com/my/workshoppaymentinfo>.

5. Edit the title of the item and set up the revenue split on the Steam Workshop website. The title is just for Reactive Drop Team admins; nobody else will see it. Usually, leaving the revenue split at 100% for yourself is correct.

6. **Important:** If your tax and bank information requires approval because this is your first curated workshop contribution, make sure you come back once you're approved (it usually takes one or two days) and click the big green "finalize revenue share" button.

7. **Optional:** Suggest a tool or service that helped you: <https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/suggestserviceproviders/?appid=563560>. Some of the portion of the donation that Valve takes as fees will go there instead.

8. Send the Reactive Drop Team admin a link to the item you created.
